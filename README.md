# BibliOS-neo4j

This software is an extension to a previous work (BibliOS) that adds new functionalities backed by a Neo4j Graph Database such as:
* Book rating
* Book tagging
* Suggestions based on personal interests

See the full documentation for more details.

### How to use ###
First you need to load the bibliosDB.sql file in a mySQL Database. Then, load the contents of the dataset.tar.gz archive in a Neo4j database. At this point you can run the 'make' command to execute the application.

### Credits ###
This project was developed in collaboration with M.Bongiovanni, G. Alvaro and G. Silvestri for the Large Scale & Multi-Structured Databases course (MsC in Computer Engineering @ University of Pisa).
